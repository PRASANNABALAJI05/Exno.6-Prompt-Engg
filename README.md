## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure

### 1. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

### 2. Load Models
Load two pre-trained language models from Hugging Face:
- GPT-Neo: `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B`
- GPT-2: `gpt2`

---

### 3. Define Functions
Create functions for generating responses from both models:
- `get_gpt_neo_answer(question)`
- `get_gpt2_answer(question)`

---

### 4. Generate Answers
Input the question _‚ÄúWhat are the benefits of renewable energy?‚Äù_ (or any other relevant question) to both models and collect their responses.

---

### 5. Compare Answers
Compare the outputs and summarize whether they are the same or different.

---

### 6. Execute the Code

---

## üíª Sample Python Code
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load GPT-Neo and GPT-2 models
generator_neo = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B')
generator_gpt2 = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Function to get answer from GPT-Neo
def get_gpt_neo_answer(question):
    generated_text = generator_neo(question, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return generated_text[0]['generated_text']

# Function to get answer from GPT-2
def get_gpt2_answer(question):
    generated_text = generator_gpt2(question, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return generated_text[0]['generated_text']

# Function to compare answers from both models
def compare_answers(question):
    answer_gpt_neo = get_gpt_neo_answer(question)
    answer_gpt2 = get_gpt2_answer(question)
    
    print("GPT-Neo Answer:", answer_gpt_neo)
    print("GPT-2 Answer:", answer_gpt2)
    
    if answer_gpt_neo == answer_gpt2:
        summary = "Both models provided the same answer."
    else:
        summary = "The answers are different."
    
    print("Summary:", summary)
    
    return {
        "question": question,
        "gpt_neo_answer": answer_gpt_neo,
        "gpt2_answer": answer_gpt2,
        "summary": summary
    }

# Run the comparison with a sample question
question = "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"
result = compare_answers(question)
print("Comparison Result:", result)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Sample Output
```
GPT-Neo Answer: Renewable energy benefits include sustainability, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and decreased dependence on fossil fuels...
GPT-2 Answer: Renewable energy is important for sustainability, energy security, and environmental protection...

Summary: The answers are different.
```

---

## üì¶ Deliverables
- ‚úÖ Python script that compares answers from GPT-Neo and GPT-2  
- ‚úÖ Comparison output showing the generated answers  
- ‚úÖ Summary indicating similarity or difference between responses  

---
Result: The corresponding Prompt is executed successfully
---
## üìù Conclusion
In this experiment, we compared the responses of two different language models‚ÄîGPT-Neo and GPT-2‚Äîto the same input question. The results showed that each model has its own style of generating responses, which is influenced by their unique training data and architecture.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Your Summary & Conclusion  
```
Write your personal analysis here. Example:  
- GPT-Neo gave a more detailed technical explanation.  
- GPT-2 focused more on general benefits.  
- This experiment shows how model choice can affect the tone and specificity of AI-generated content.
